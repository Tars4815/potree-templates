<p><strong>Point Budget Slider</strong></p>
<p>The point budget limits the number of points loaded and rendered at any given time, which helps to adapt performance requirements to the capabilities of different hardware. It gives you a complete version of point clouds.</p>
<p>Potree Viewer will save the previous selected point budget as the default point budget when the viewer is loaded next time.</p>
<p><strong>Field of View</strong></p>
<p>To control viewable range of point clouds elements to be included within the scene, the field of view can be adjusted. Default value is set to 55 degrees. The field of view will determine how much of the pointcloud you can see in your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Dome-lightning</strong></p>
<p>The Potree Point Cloud viewer module can implement eye dome-lighting, a lighting model that highlights the shapes of objects.</p>
<p>Eye Dome-lighting group objects, shade their outlines and enhances depth perception in scientific visualization images.</p>
<p>It is useful for recognition and measurement of structures within pointcloud. It can be modified by adjusting Radius, Strength, and Opacity.Those are set to give you tight controls of movement with in the model.</p>
<p>By default, Eye Dome-Lighting is enabled on Potree viewer, but it can be disabled by clicking on the enable option.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Potree viewer background can be modified with following available options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Skybox</p></li>
<li><p>Gradient</p></li>
<li><p>Black and white</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Splat Quality</strong></p>
<p>Standard/High quality are two different splat method which will give you the different viewing experience on your computer. Choose the one that works better for you.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Min node size - impacts the point density of the nodes represented.</p></li>
<li><p>Box - Displays the boxes of the nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock view - Lock the point cloud view, preventing to load or unload points to the model.</p></li>
</ul>
